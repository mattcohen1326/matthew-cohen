        <p class = "back">I grew up in Millburn, New Jersey.  Growing up my main passions included playing hockey, listening to music, and solving puzzles.  
        I always loved playing with legos and creating things. I went to Millburn High School where I took computer science classes and learned Java.  
        During my time there I developed a game in Corona SDK and attempted to build a home made drone with a team of five.  
        These experiences in highschool sparked my interest that would lead me to my Computer Science Major at CU Boulder.
