        <p class = "home">	I have been coding ever since the first computer science class I took freshman year of high school.  
        Ever since I have enjoyed using my creativity to solve logic based puzzles.  
        During the two years of my education at the University of Colorado I have picked up many useful skills.  
        My strengths are C++ and html.  While these are my strong suits I also know many other languages such as SQL, css,  
        git, linux, javascript and python.  I am more than willing to learn new languages as tasks require as I often find myself doing in my projects.  
        I have another website along with this one which is more of a passion project.  You can check that out at: 
        <a href = "http://milkywaves.org">Milky Waves</a>
        .  On the more technical side I was a team member for a web app which takes 
        temperature sensor data and displays it on a web page.  This app encorporated databases along with python scripting to create the graph.  
        The code for this can be found at:
        <a href = "https://github.com/Natty-Laugh/final-project">Temperature Repository</a>.  I can be a strong member of any team and am eager for learning experiences.  
        You can find out more about me here on my site.
